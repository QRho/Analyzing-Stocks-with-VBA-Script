THis is the readme for the # VBA Homework - The VBA of Wall Street Challenge
I didnt get to either of the challenges but I did a little extra work on the script to make it more readable to me. 
I only added the opening and ending columns in the summary area so that I could more clearly check my work. 
Script files for each year are included as well as a screenshot of each year. 
I would love to create some piviot tables with this data but I am on to Python!
